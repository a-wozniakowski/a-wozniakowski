About
----------------

Currently, I am a software engineer at Apple. Previously, I completed my
doctoral studies in [mathematics](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms) at Nanyang
Technological University (NTU); and I am an original member of the
[Mathematical Picture Language Project](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/)
at Harvard University.

Research Highlights
----------------

* Fundamentally, the traditional formulation of gradient boosting
  neglects the means to explicitly incorporate prior knowledge into
  the fit of an additive model, which is of great practical importance
  in the low training example regime. The stacked formulation, in
  contradistinction, endows [gradient boosting][1] with the ability
  to additively and adaptively improve upon prior regression predictions
  from a base model, which encodes domain-specific knowledge about the
  regression task at hand; see the Scikit-physlearn [repository][2] and
  its [documentation][3].
* Typically, the science of quantum information and computation is thought
  about from a purely algebraic prespective. That is, one tends to draw
  planar pictures of circuitry, which represent quantum objects. Then, one
  composes these pictures of circuitry in an algebraic way to create more 
  elaborate quantum objects, such as quantum teleportation. The charged string,
  picture language differs from this paradigm in that it enables us to think
  about the science of quantum information and computation in either an algebraic
  or a topological way such that there exists a bidirectional dictionary between
  our two modes of thought. To this end, the [two-string][4], picture language
  establishes a link between the theory of planar para algebras and the science
  of quantum information and computation, and it yields an [application][5] in
  quantum teleportation. Moreover, the [four-string][6], picture language extends
  the paradigm to three dimensions.
