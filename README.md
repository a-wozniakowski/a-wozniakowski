About
----------------

I am a PhD candidate in [mathematics](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms) at Nanyang
Technological University (NTU), who works in machine learning, statistics, and
applied and computational mathematics. I am also an original member of the
[Mathematical Picture Language Project](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/)
at Harvard University.

Research Highlights
----------------

* A new formulation of gradient boosting: endows [gradient boosting][1] with
  the ability to improve upon prior regression predictions from a base model,
  which encodes domain-specific knowledge about the regression task at hand;
  see the Scikit-physlearn [repository][2] and its [documentation][3].
* Charged string, picture languages: new [two-string][4] and [four-string][5]
  picture languages for quantum information with an [application][6] in quantum
  teleportation.
