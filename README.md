About
----------------

Currently, I am a software engineer at Apple. Previously, I completed a
PhD in [mathematics](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms) at Nanyang
Technological University (NTU) with a dissertation on a
[reformulation of additive models](https://hdl.handle.net/10356/163311).
Moreover, I am an original member of the 
[Mathematical Picture Language Project](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/)
at Harvard University.

Research Highlights
----------------

* Additive models and their fitting algorithms play a pivotal role
  in the history and development of applied mathematics, machine 
  learning, statistics, and science. Yet, the traditional methodology
  neglects the means to explicitly incorporate prior knowledge into the
  fit of an additive model. A [reformulation of additive models][1]
  introduces an inductive bias that enables additive models and their
  fitting algorithms to acquire, and leverage, prior knowledge in the
  form of predictions from a regression model. 
* Empirically, this approach to transfer learning outperformed the most
  widely applied gradient boosting libraries, as well as Googleâ€™s
  cutting-edge quantum physics model, on several data sets; see
  the [repo][2] and [documentation][3] for the implementation of
  [base boosting][4].
* The aforementioned approach arose in the context of superconducting
  quantum device calibration, which is an application that belongs
  to the science of quantum information and computation. The latter
  is a field of science, which many think about algebraically in terms
  of modular, quantum circuit elements. That is, they tend to draw planar
  pictures of circuitry, which represent quantum objects, such as qudits
  and their transformations. Then, they compose these pictures of
  circuitry in an algebraic way to create more elaborate quantum objects.
* The charged string, picture language differs from this paradigm in that
  it enables us to think about the science of quantum information and
  computation in either an algebraic or a topological way such that
  there exists a bidirectional dictionary between our two modes of thought;
  see the [two-string][5] and [four-string][6] languages, as well as the
  [teleportation protocol][7].
