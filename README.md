About
----------------

Currently, I am a software engineer at Apple. Previously, I completed a
PhD in [mathematics](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms) at Nanyang
Technological University (NTU) with a dissertation on a
[reformulation of additive models](https://hdl.handle.net/10356/163311). 
Moreover, I am an original member of the 
[Mathematical Picture Language Project](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/)
at Harvard University.

Research Highlights
----------------

* Additive models and their fitting algorithms play a pivotal role
  in the history and development of applied and computational
  mathematics, machine learning, statistics, and science. The
  [dissertation][1] introduces an inductive bias that enables
  additive models and their fitting algorithms to acquire, and
  leverage, prior knowledge in the form of predictions from a
  regression model.
* Numerical experiments on several data sets demonstrate the
  viability of this approach to transfer learning, as it
  outperformed the most widely applied gradient boosting
  libraries and Googleâ€™s cutting-edge quantum physics model;
  see the [dissertation][1], [base boosting paper][2],
  [repository][3], and [documentation][4].
* Also, on a different front, charged string picture languages
  establish a link between the theory of planar para algebras,
  which combines insights from the mathematics of subfactor theory
  and planar algebras with the mathematical physics of parafermions,
  and the science of quantum information and computation; see the
  [dissertation][1], [two-string paper][5], [four-string paper][6],
  and the [teleportation protocol paper][7].
