=========================================

I am a PHD candidate in mathematics at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/),
who is interested in designing and deploying machine learning systems. I am also a member of the
Mathematical Picture Language Project at [Harvard University](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/).


Research
----------------

* Base boosting: a new [approach][1] to transferring prior domain knowledge to gradient boosting.
* Charged string languages: new [two-string][2] and [four-string][3] pictorial languages
for quantum information, and an [application][4] in quantum teleportation.
